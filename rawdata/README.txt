- NUMBEROFEDGES: number of edges in the ESG4WSC model.

- CPP_TIME: generation time of the CPP algorithm in nanoseconds.

- ETA_TIME: generation time of the ETA algorithm in nanoseconds.

- ETAP_TIME: generation time of the ETA+P algorithm in nanoseconds.

- GETA_TIME: generation time of the GETA algorithm in nanoseconds.

- GETAP_TIME: generation time of the GETA+P algorithm in nanoseconds.

- CPP_CES: number of CESs (test sequences) in the test suite generated by CPP.

- ETA_CES: number of CESs (test sequences) in the test suite generated by ETA.
